# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
This Node.js application takes simple user inputs and produces a (somewhat) professional looking logo in SVG format, meaning it can be scalable to any size needs.

## Installation
To install:
 - Clone this [Github Repo](https://github.com/morgs999/SVG-Logo-Maker.git)
 - Navigate to its pathway in your computer terminal
 - Install [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) via 'npm install inquirer@8.2.4'
 - Install [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) via 'npm install jest'
 - Run the 'index.js' file in Node.js.

 ## Usage
 - The user can input any number of characters, but 3 is recommended for presentation
 - Colors can be entered either as keyword (red, blue, black), RGB (rgb(255,0,0)), or Hexadecimal (#FF0000).  Incorrect color codes or keywords will return an error however.
 - Logos are genereated at 300x200 pixels, but SVG file types are scalable!  There is a 'sample.html' file which you can drop the SVG file in to see how it looks.
 - You can view this [video walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CqbzskjhL2EWP9fxpFJJJdi-dIhb9Z4d/view?usp=sharing) to see the application in use.
 - And this is a sample logo generated with the application:\
